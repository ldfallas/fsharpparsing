# Implementation of a small programming language parser

This project is an experiment for creating a parser for a small programming language. Its main feature is that blocks are defined by using indentation (just like Python).

The parser is implemented using the F# programming language. A journal of things learned are recorded in theses series of blog posts: <http://langexplr.blogspot.com/2017/01/a-simple-language-with-indentation.html> .

The `tests.fs` file contains a small set of tests for the code and a main program to run them.
